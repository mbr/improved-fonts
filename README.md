# improved-fonts
A lot of effort has been put into crafting this finely tuned `.fonts.conf` file. It contains tweaks and tasteful font substitutions drawing upon decades of typographic research. Any user of the configuration can enjoy the subtle tweaks while without changing any settings.

Be sure to install this on your coworker's machines as well to spread great taste in fonts.

The package has been thoroughly tested on Debian Jessie and Stretch. It does require the `ttf-mscorefonts-installer` package to be installed though.


## Known issues

Even though it works well enough in editors like Sublime Text, normal desktop applications and most webpages, some terminal emulators and a few website are still holding out. PRs to fix these issues are much welcome.
